# Why Integrate Data?

## Data are messy

# The Model Framework

## The Pieces

- $P(Y_d | \lambda(\mathbf{s}), \theta_d)$:  One observation model per data set
- $P(\lambda(\mathbf{s}))$ One process model

Full likelihood

$$
L(Y | \theta_d) = P(\lambda(\mathbf{s})) \prod_{d=1}^{M}P(Y_d | \lambda(\mathbf{s}), \theta_d)
$$

## Point Processes

Point processes are defined on a continuous space

- intensity $\lambda({\bf s})$

For an area $A$, mean number of points in area is 

$$
\mu_A = \int_A \lambda({\bf s}) d{\bf s}
$$

Actual number follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\mu_A$

## Observation processes

- Counts: $N_A \sim Poisson(p \mu_A)$
- Presence/Absence: $(N_A >0) \sim Bern( 1-e^{-p \mu_A})$ (=cloglog)
- Points: Thinned point process 

# Why have a package?

- not easy to code from scratch
- lots of pieces that are the same between models
- models are modular, so a package can help piece them together

# What we will do today

- Exercise 1: your first model with `PointedSDMs`
- Presentation 2: What you just did (and why)
- Exercise 2: A bit more modelling: how to change the model
- Presentation 3: Multi-species models
- Exercise 3: Multi-species models
- Discussion and wrapping up


# Exercise 1: Your first (and second?) model

First: pull from the  *Github* repository: *https://github.com/PhilipMostert/PointedSDMs*

devtools::install_github('PhilipMostert/PointedSDMs@main')

(this is more recent than CRAN)

Then pull the workshop: *PhilipMostert/PointedSDMs_Workshop.*


The first exercise is here:
